# CaptchaAutomation
Automation of captcha using Selenium with java

For past few days, i was working on Captcha automation with Selenium(java) and i was able to automate it using Scanner class for manually solving it and then entering the solved captcha and then using selenium with java for handling the rest using a test website. It also takes a screenshot of the captcha for future references if there is any human error during manually solving the captcha. I have used try-catch block for exception handling and soft assertion for validation.
